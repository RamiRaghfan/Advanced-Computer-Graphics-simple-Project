2D simple animations  

program with the following functionalities:
- When the user presses specific keyboard keys (3 different keys of your choice), one of the 
following objects will be drawn at random points in space (but visible on the screen!). Only 
one object should be visible at a time.
• Square
• Hexagon
• Octagon
- When the user presses specific keyboard keys (“T”, “S” and “R”), transformations can be 
applied to the object:
• Press T: Translate the object over time (create the illusion of continuous movement from 
left to right and back) – the object should start the back movement when it reached the 
(right) end of the window
• Press S: Scale the object over time (create the illusion of making the object bigger and 
then smaller) – the object should start shrinking after reaching a size that fills the whole 
window 
• Press R: Rotate the object over time around its own center
